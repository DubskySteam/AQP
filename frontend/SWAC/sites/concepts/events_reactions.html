                Every important, concurrent action in SWAC fires events when it
                changes it's state. Those events can be used to execute custom code
                at the right time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="uk-heading-divider">State events</h2>
            <p>The following table lists all events from SWAC core. Events fired
                from components will be listed there.
            </p>
            <table class="uk-table">
                <tr><th>Corepart</th><th>Event name</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
                <tr><td>swac</td><td>uiComplete</td><td>Fired when the user interface was loaded. (This is when swac system is initialised, but before all components are ready)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>swac</td><td>swac_component_loaded</td><td>Fired when a single component has loaded. The requestor is given in detail field requestor</td></tr>
                <tr><td>swac</td><td>swac_REQUESTOR.ID_complete</td><td>Fired by the requestor when it has completed its init() function.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>swac</td><td>swac_components_complete</td><td>Fired when all components have loaded.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>swac</td><td>swac_REQUESTOR.ID_reloaded</td><td>Fired when one component has reloaded.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>swac</td><td>swac_fetchfail_STATUSCODE</td><td>Fired when an fetch attempt fails. STATUSCODE is the HTTP status code. (e.g. 401)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>swac</td><td>swac_REQUESTOR.ID_inactive</td><td>Fired by the requestor when option 'activeOn' resolves to inactive.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>View</td><td>swac_REQUESTOR.ID_repeatedForSet</td><td>Fired when a new gui element was created for an added set. Carries requestor, repeateds (DOM Elements), and set</td></tr>
                <tr><td>View</td><td>swac_REQUESTOR.ID_invi</td><td>Fired when the requestors DOM element enters or leaves the viewport (e.g. visibility to user changes)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>View</td><td>swac_REQUESTOR.ID_endvi</td><td>Fired when the user reaches the end of the components view by scrolling down. Also fires if the end leaves the viewport.</td></tr>

            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
// Register event handler
document.addEventListener('swac_' + requestor.id + '_reloaded', function (evt) {
    // Do something here
});
        </code></pre>

            <h2 class="uk-heading-divider">Online events</h2>
            <p>SWAC brings support for actions performed when a client loses his 
                internet connection, the server is not reachable or the client goes online 
                again.
                <br>Online / offline functions either work together with the progressive
                functionality and / or without it.</p>

            <h3>Offline / Online informations</h3>
            <p>The user becomes an information if his client goes offline or the 
                connection to the backend is lost, so no user must wonder why something
                is not working. You can deactiate this by changeing the configuration:</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
                offlineNotify: false,
</code></pre>
            
            <h3>Extend your site with online / offline functions</h3>
            <p>Even without useing a component you can extend your site with online
                / offline functions by extending a simple class and adding a configuration.</p>

            Implementing a reaction set by extending the OnlineReaction class:
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
var MyReactFactory = {};
MyReactFactory.create = function (config) {
    return new MyReact(config);
};

class MyReact extends OnlineReaction {
    constructor(config) {
        super(config);
    }

    onOnline(evt) {
        console.log('Upload onOnline reaction');
    }

    onOffline(evt) {
        console.log('Upload onOffline reaction');
    }

    onUnreachable(evt) {
        console.log('Upload onUnreachable action');
    }
}
        </code></pre>

            Write an entry to the configuration.js to make the actions available on
            all pages.
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
SWAC_config.onlinereactions[0] = {
    path: 'path/to/MyReact.js',
    config: {
       someopts: 'Specify some opts here for your config'
    }
};
        </code></pre>

            <h3>Components with online / offline functionality</h3>
            <p>All swac components can be easily extended with functions that will
                be executed if client goes online / offline. It's done the
                same way like defining a OnlineReaction without component except that the
                script is located within the plugins directory.</p>

            <h2 class="uk-heading-divider">Reactions</h2>
            <p>
                With Reactions you can register functions that will be executed
                when a requestors component is completely loaded.
                <br>Furthermore you can register functions that are executed
                when all requestors from a list are completely loaded. You just 
                have to list the names of the requestors as second and so on 
                parameter.
            </p>

            <h3>Combining components</h3>
            <p>Reactions allow it to combine components functunalities. So you can
                create a reaction that executes when the search and the present component
                are loaded and register code to update the presents data if a search
                was performed.</p>

            <h3>Example 1: Register Reaction to single requestor</h3>
            <p>The simplest useage is to wait for a component to be ready and 
            than execute a function.</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
// Wait for swac reaction system to be ready
document.addEventListener('swac_ready', function () {
    // Register reaction to the component with id "head_navigation"
    window.swac.reactions.addReaction(function () {
        alert("This is a reaction: head_navigation is loaded.");
    }, "head_navigation");
});
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Example 2: Register Reaction to multiple requestors</h3>
            <p>A bit more advanced you can wait for two (or more) components 
            and execute a function when they all are ready.</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
// Wait for swac reaction system to be ready
document.addEventListener('swac_ready', function () {
    // Register reaction to the compoenents "selectobject" and "chart"
    window.swac.reactions.addReaction(function (requestors) {
        // Accessing the requestors
        let selectobjectreq = requestors['selectobject'];
        let chartreq = requestors['chart'];
        // Here you can do anything on those booth components
    }, "selectobject", "chart");
});
            </code></pre>
